# Cookiecutter Template for Sage Apps

This repo is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template to quickly bootstrap new Sage apps.

Once you've installed cookiecutter (see their docs), simply run:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:waggle-sensor/cookiecutter-sage-app
```

This will create a new app with the `repo` name you provide cookiecutter.
