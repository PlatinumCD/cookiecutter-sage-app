# Cookiecutter Template for Sage Apps

This repo is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template to quickly bootstrap new Sage apps.

First, make sure you've installed cookiecutter:

```sh
pip3 install cookiecutter
```

Then, run the following:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:waggle-sensor/cookiecutter-sage-app
```

This will create a new app with the `repo` name you provide cookiecutter.
